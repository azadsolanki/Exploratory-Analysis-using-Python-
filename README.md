# Exploratory-Analysis-using-Python-
Applied computational thinking using Python on SF Bay Area Bike Share data 

Context
The Bay Area Bike Share enables quick, easy, and affordable bike trips around the San Francisco Bay Area. They make regular open data releases (this dataset is a transformed version of the data from this link), plus maintain a real-time API.

Content
station.csv - Contains data that represents a station where users can pickup or return bikes.

status.csv - data about the number of bikes and docks available for given station and minute.

trips.csv - Data about individual bike trips

weather.csv - Data about the weather on a specific day for certain zip codes

Acknowledgements
This dataset is a transformed version of the Bay area bike share data.

Inspiration
How does weather impact bike trips?
How do bike trip patterns vary by time of day and the day of the week?

Note: In this session we are interested in exploring trips data
